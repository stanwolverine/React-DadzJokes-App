# Dadz Jokes Project

> This application fatches 10 random jokes from an API each time you tell it to. This App makes sure that we don't get a dupliacte joke as API has no method to do so.

> Note: This app uses localStorage to store the fetched jokes, so that user can access his fatched jokes later.

- User can upvote and downvote jokes, jokes will be sorted as per the votes when user refreshes page.

- There is currently no way to delete jokes, instead ofcourse clearing local storage.

- Smiley at the end of each joke, changes expression as soon as joke starts getting good or bad votes.
